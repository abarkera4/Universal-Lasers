# Universal Lasers for Resident Evil 4 Remake

## || What Do? ||
========================

- **Laser Sights** for all weapons with 7 color options! Works in Mercenaries and Separate Ways.
- Color choice is remembered when restarting the game.
- Lasers turn on when you aim and turn off when you stop aiming.
- Dynamic Weapon Profiles is highly recommended to turn reticles off. It also offers many useful options for weapon tuning and balance profiles.
- Bullets Come From The Muzzle is required and needs to be installed first using [Fluffy Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/14).

## || IMPORTANT NOTES ||
========================

- **Scripted sequences** like the minecart sequence will break the lasers. **Reset scripts** in the REFramework menu to bring them back.
- The lasers won't work while riding the cart, but resetting scripts will bring them back during the intermission and after the sequence.
- Scroll down to **Troubleshooting** if you need help resetting scripts.
- The CQBR with scopes attached acts strangely. The laser dot still indicates where bullets will land, and you can still hit targets. A fix is in progress.

## || Extra Notes ||
========================
- The laser beam and dot size can be changed at the top of the script. Adjust the size parameter based on recommended defaults and tune to your liking.
